# sass-tests

Proof-of-concept test examples for testing Sass with True. Follow commit history for incremental development or just grok-and-go.

This is also turning into a repo where I put interesting mixins and functions even if I can't get the True tests to work, cos I prefer repos to Gists.

## Run tests

`npm t`
